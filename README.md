## Project 1 _iPywidgets with Bokeh
<p>This demos shows off an interactive visualization using Bokeh for plotting and ipywidgets interactors. No Bokeh server required. The demo runs entirely inside Jupyter notebook.<p>
<p>The impact of the mass, friction coefficient, and phase is analyzed within  the friction equation for a block of mass m. The block is on a inclined plane with angle x. <p>
<p>First BokehJS is loaded successfully.  Angle degrees and the friction funtion is defined next.<p>
<p>The chart and plot line options are selected (height, width, chart title, vertical axe range).<p>

<p>The function 'update' will build the scroll down list with the diferrent trogonometric functions to see the impact of each of them  in the friction of the block. <p>
<p>Display of the friction chart follows. Final step, interact command display all the interactors.<p> Friction equation can be studied. 
<p>The impact of the selected variables (mass, friction coefficient, phase) analyze.<p>
