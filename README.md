This demos shows off an interactive visualization using Bokeh for plotting and ipywidgets interactors. No Bokeh server required. The demo runs entirely inside Jupyter notebook.
The impact of the mass, friction coefficient, and phase is analyzed within  the friction equation for a block of mass m. The block is on a inclined plane with angle x.
First BokehJS is loaded successfully.  Angle degrees and the friction funtion is defined next.
The chart and plot line options are selected (height, width, chart title, vertical axe range).
The function 'update' will build the scroll down list with the diferrent trogonometric functions to see the impact of each of them  in the friction of the block. 
Display of the chart follows. Final step, interact command display all the interactors. Friction equation can be studied and analyze the impact of the selected variables (mass, friction coefficient, phase).
